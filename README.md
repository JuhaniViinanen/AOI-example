# AOI-example
An simple python GUI-app to label images
- uses tkinter and pillow; enviroment.yml for conda env
- example images are from pixabay.com

## Notes
- very barebones, only meant to showcase how a basic image labeling app might work
- no database functionality, images are read from a folder and results are written to csv
